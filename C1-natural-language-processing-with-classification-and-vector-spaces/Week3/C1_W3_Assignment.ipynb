    "Euclidean distance between the original vectors and their projected siblings is\n",
    "minimal. Hence vectors that were originally close in the embeddings dictionary,\n",
    "will produce lower dimensional vectors that are still close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that when you map out the words, similar words will be clustered\n",
    "next to each other. For example, the words 'sad', 'happy', 'joyful' all describe\n",

    "Words like 'city', 'village', 'town' could be seen as synonyms and describe a\n",
    "similar thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before plotting the words, you need to first be able to reduce each word vector\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Mean normalize the data\n",
    "2. Compute the covariance matrix of your data ($\\Sigma$). \n",
